Announcing a build of Tiny Core Linux for the OLPC XO.

This is useful for testing, diagnosis, and recovery of filesystems on
an unlocked XO.

My thanks to George Hunt and Yioryos Asprobounitis for all their hard
work toward this.  All I did was pull the strings, I reckon.


Features:

- runs on XO-1, XO-1.5, XO-1.75, or XO-4,

- configured for a single root shell in text mode, with alternate
  consoles available for login,

- based on Core 4.7.6, uses the OLPC kernel from 13.2.0-7, and
  includes latest signed Open Firmware versions for automatic upgrade,

- includes wireless firmware for each laptop, and wireless
  tools from Tiny Core Linux.

Known bugs:
