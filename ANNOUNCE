Announcing a build of Tiny Core Linux for XO-1 and XO-1.5 based on
OLPC build 802 and os108.

I've found this useful for testing and diagnosis without touching the
internal NAND or SD storage.

Features:

- based on Tiny Core Linux 2.8 microcore variant, configured for a
  single root shell in text mode,

- uses the OLPC kernel, for hardware support,

- includes the wireless firmware shipped with OLPC builds, and binary
  redistribution of wireless tools from the same builds,
