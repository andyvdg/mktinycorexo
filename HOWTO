How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB drive
from upstream distribution components:

1.  select a system for building with; last tested on an XO-4 running
    OLPC OS 13.2.0 but any recent Linux system should do,  
    
2.  ensure you have an internet connection, (the script
    obtains all the needed files from the internet if they are not 
    available on your system),

3.  clone the repository,

    git clone http://dev.laptop.org/~quozl/mktinycorexo/.git
    cd mktinycorexo
    
4.  Optional: select a USB drive that has nothing on it that is wanted, 
    plug it your build system and identify the USB drive from 
    /proc/partitions, such as /dev/sda1.
    unmount it if it was automatically mounted,

5.  as root run the script:

    sudo mktinycorexo /dev/sda1

    ... where /dev/sda1 is the answer you obtained from step 4 above, if used
    (take care, because any directory called boot on this device will
    be changed),

6.  wait for completion,

7.  Optional: if step 4 above is skipped insert a USB drive to copy the 
    build files as directed, 

8.  boot from the USB drive,

9.  if disk space is required, you can remove the cache/ directory, as
    it contains downloads only.
    
Run `mktinicorexo --help' for additional options
