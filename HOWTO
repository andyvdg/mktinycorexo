How to create a Tiny Core Linux bootable USB drive
from upstream distribution components:

1.  select a USB drive that has nothing on it that is wanted,

2.  select a system for building with; last tested on an XO-1.5
running OLPC OS 10.1.2 build os852, or use some other Linux system,
(the script obtains the kernel from the internet if it is not
available on your system), then plug the USB drive into it,

3.  identify the USB drive from /proc/partitions, such as /dev/sdc1,

4.  ensure you have an internet connection,

5.  as root run the script:

    mktinycorexo /dev/sdc1

... where /dev/sdc1 is the answer you obtained from step 3 above,
(take care, because any directory called boot on this device will be
modified),

6.  wait for completion,

7.  boot from the USB drive.
